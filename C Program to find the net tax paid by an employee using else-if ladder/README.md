using else-if ladder find the net tax paid by an employee.

The progressive income tax rate is mandated as follows:

| Taxable Income | Rate (%) |
|----------------|----------|
| First $20,000  |    0     |
| Next $20,000   |   10     |
| Next $20,000   |   20     |
| The remaining  |   30     |

For example, suppose that the taxable income is $85,000 , the income tax payable is:

$20,000 * 0% + $20,000 * 10% + $20,800 * 20% + $25,890 * 30%
